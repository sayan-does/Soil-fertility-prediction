# Soil Fertility Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting soil fertility by employing machine learning models. The dataset underwent preprocessing, including standardization and outlier removal based on boxplot analysis. Four different models were trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Standardization:**
   - All features were standardized to ensure consistent scales, aiding model convergence.

2. **Outlier Removal:**
   - Identified and removed outliers using boxplots to enhance the robustness of the models.

## Models Trained

1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - A linear model used for binary classification.

2. **Random Forest Classifier:**
   - An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.

3. **Decision Tree:**
   - A standalone decision tree model for classification.

4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):**
   - A deep learning model with multiple layers, capable of learning complex patterns.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy Score:**
  - A measure of overall classification performance.

- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - Visual representation of model performance, depicting true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
